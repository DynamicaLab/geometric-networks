1. Propagating patterns of intrinsic activity along macroscale gradients coordinate functional connections across the whole brain
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192100104X

Notes: waves propagate along macroscale cortical gradients, as (qualitatively) observed using quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs)

Notes: graph laplacian yields eigenmodes that look like RSNs

propagating waves underlie resting-state functional connectivity

Notes: Mouse widefield imaging; calcium waves explain a fraction of hemodynamic FC.

Notes: Time delays can serve as a generative mechanism for traveling waves.
