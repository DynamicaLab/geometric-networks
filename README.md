# Function aligns with geometry in locally connected networks

Python code for the "Function aligns with geometry in locally connected networks" manuscript, available on bioRxiv.

# Overview

Analyses from the paper are conducted in multiple Jupyter notebooks found in the `Notebooks/` folder and generally split into 2 categories: some that compute results for specific figures of the paper (`FigureX-Analysis` notebooks), and some that take these results to generate figures (`FigureX-Layout` notebooks) for subsequent modifications using Inkscape. All notebooks import functions in local `.py` files within the repository, and supplementary analyses are done in `Supp-` notebooks. Some analyses were computed externally on Compute Canada clusters, and the code can be accessed in the `ComputeCanada` folder. The data required to replicate the analyses can be downloaded here. Raw calcium imaging data are available upon reasonable request.

# Notebooks list

In progress.

# Installation

Download this repository, then run the notebooks in a Python environment equipped with the appropriate packages, which can all be pip installed easily. Some notebooks will load files in a `Files/` folder, and output files in a `Results/` folder, both of which should be manually created and placed in the main folder of the repository.
