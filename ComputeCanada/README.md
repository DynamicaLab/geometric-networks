# Compute Canada scripts

This folder contains Python code of various analyses that were conducted on the Narval cluster from the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en/about/alliance).

# Notes

In each folder, a reduced version of the `main.py` file was included alongside the `script.py` file, and a minimal set of packages was installed in the `submit.sh` bash file. The current `main.py` file located within the main folder of the repository contains the majority of the code for the paper and is most likely incompatible with the minimal packages provided in the current `submit.sh` files. These codes are provided as examples, and reproducing the analyses would require either generating a reduced `.py` file, or installing additonal packages in the `.sh` file.
